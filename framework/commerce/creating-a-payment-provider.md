# ðŸ¥š Payment

## Overview

A payment provider represents a payment method with which an order can be paid in the frontend. Furthermore, it contains other optional methods, e.g. to later capture the payment amount when the goods are shipped or to perform a refund. It is recommended to learn about the general functioning of a [provider](../platform/modularity-and-providers.md#providers) before going on.

If no SDK is provided for a payment gateway or if you do not want to use it for whatever reason, then it is recommended to write your own HTTP client for communicating with the gateway. See the [PayPal HTTP client](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Modules/Smartstore.PayPal/Client/PayPalHttpClient.cs) as an example.

## Payment provider

The payment provider contains all important functions for a specific payment method. A module can contain any number of payment providers and thus any number of payment methods.

TIP: It is recommended to implement the payment methods of a payment company (like PayPal) in one module, not in many. In other words, the module should represent a certain payment company or gateway.

To create a payment provider add a class that inherits from `PaymentMethodBase` and optionally implements `IConfigurable`.

{% code title="A simple payment provider" %}
```csharp
[SystemName("MyCompany.MyCreditCardPayment")]
[FriendlyName("My credit card payment")]
[Order(1)]
public class MyCreditCardProvider : PaymentMethodBase, IConfigurable
{
    private readonly ICheckoutStateAccessor _checkoutStateAccessor;
    
    public MyCreditCardProvider(ICheckoutStateAccessor checkoutStateAccessor)
    {
        _checkoutStateAccessor = checkoutStateAccessor;
    }
    
    public RouteInfo GetConfigurationRoute()
        => new(nameof(MyPaymentAdminController.Configure), "MyPaymentAdmin", new { area = "Admin" });

    public override Widget GetPaymentInfoWidget()
        => new ComponentWidget(typeof(MyCreditCardInfoViewComponent));

    public override Task<ProcessPaymentResult> ProcessPaymentAsync(ProcessPaymentRequest processPaymentRequest)
    {
        var state = _checkoutStateAccessor.CheckoutState.GetCustomState<MyCustomCheckoutState>();

        // TODO: HTTP client that authorizes the payment against the payment gateway.
        // Uses "state" to temporarily save the result. Throws an exception on any failure.
        _ = await _httpClient.Authorize(state, processPaymentRequest.StoreId);

        return new ProcessPaymentResult
        {
            NewPaymentStatus = PaymentStatus.Authorized,
            AuthorizationTransactionId = state.Decision.TransactionId,
            AuthorizationTransactionCode = state.Id
        };
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

For details about `SystemName` etc. see [providers](../platform/modularity-and-providers.md#providers). There are a number of properties and methods that the provider should override.

## Payment method filter

Payment methods can be filtered using [IPaymentMethodFilter](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Checkout/Payment/Service/IPaymentMethodFilter.cs). Such an implementation is useful, for example, when a payment method should generally only be offered if a certain shopping cart amount is exceeded.

{% code title="Example of a payment filter" %}
```csharp
public partial class MyCustomPaymentFilter : IPaymentMethodFilter
{
    // Check provider acceptance once a day.
    const int CheckAcceptanceHours = 24;

    private readonly Lazy<MyPaymentProviderHttpClient> _httpClient;
    private readonly Lazy<IOrderCalculationService> _orderCalculationService;
    private readonly Lazy<ISettingFactory> _settingFactory;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public MyCustomPaymentFilter(
        Lazy<MyPaymentProviderHttpClient> httpClient,
        Lazy<IOrderCalculationService> orderCalculationService,
        Lazy<ISettingFactory> settingFactory,
        ILogger logger)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _orderCalculationService = orderCalculationService;
        _settingFactory = settingFactory;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<bool> IsExcludedAsync(PaymentFilterRequest request)
    {
        try
        {
            if (request.PaymentMethod.Metadata.SystemName.EqualsNoCase("Payments.MyCustomPurchaseByInstallment"))
            {
                var settings = await _settingFactory.Value.LoadSettingsAsync<MyPaymentSettings>(request.StoreId);
                if (!settings.HasCredentials() || !settings.IsAcceptedByPaymentProvider)
                {
                    return true;
                }

                if (request.Cart != null)
                {
                    Money? cartTotal = await _orderCalculationService.Value.GetShoppingCartTotalAsync(request.Cart);
                    if (cartTotal == null || cartTotal.Value <= decimal.Zero || cartTotal.Value < settings.FinancingMin || cartTotal.Value > settings.FinancingMax)
                    {
                        // Cart total is not financeable.
                        return true;
                    }
                }

                if ((DateTime.UtcNow - settings.LastAcceptanceCheckedOn).TotalHours > CheckAcceptanceHours)
                {
                    try
                    {
                        await _httpClient.Value.UpdateAcceptedByPaymentProviderAsync(settings, request.StoreId);
                        if (!settings.IsAcceptedByPaymentProvider)
                        {
                            // Payment provider does not accept any further payment.
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                    catch (Exception ex)
                    {
                        _logger.Error(ex);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.Error(ex);
        }

        return false
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Custom checkout state

In most cases, session-based data must be stored during the checkout in order to communicate with the payment provider's API. This includes, for example, the ID of the payment transaction or session. Use the `CheckoutState` property of [ICheckoutStateAccessor](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Checkout/Orders/Services/ICheckoutStateAccessor.cs) to store any custom session data during checkout. Your state object must inherit from `ObservableObject`.

{% code title="Custom checkout state object example" %}
```csharp
[Serializable]
public class MyCustomCheckoutState : ObservableObject
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Technical transaction ID used in URLs for communication between 
    /// the module and API.
    /// </summary>
    public string Id
    {
        get => GetProperty<string>();
        set => SetProperty(value);
    }

    public string TransactionDataHash
    {
        get => GetProperty<string>();
        set => SetProperty(value);
    }

    public MyPaymentDecision Decision
    {
        get => GetProperty<MyPaymentDecision>();
        set => SetProperty(value);
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

The `ObservableObject` allows changes to the state object to be automatically applied to the session. So no `ISession.TrySetObject` or similar has to be executed.

```csharp
public override Task<ProcessPaymentRequest> GetPaymentInfoAsync(IFormCollection form)
{
    var state = _checkoutStateAccessor.CheckoutState.GetCustomState<MyCustomCheckoutState>();
    var (id, hash) = await CreateTransaction();
    state.Id = id;
    state.TransactionDataHash = hash;

    return new ProcessPaymentRequest
    {
        OrderGuid = Guid.NewGuid()
    };
}

private Task<(string ID, string DataHash)> CreateTransaction()
{
    // TODO: create a transaction using API and get back its ID.
    var id = "1.de.4145.1-0303135329-211";
    var hash = "1c05aa56405c447e6678b7f312
    return Task.FromResult((id, hash));
}
```

WARN: the checkout state has a limited scope by design. This starts from the shopping cart page and ends with the creation of the order. On the checkout completed page, for example, the checkout state no longer exists. If you want to keep data longer, then you have to either store it in the database or put it in a separate session object.

## Storing additional order data

The payment module provides current payment data via result objects such as `ProcessPaymentResult`, which are stored by the core directly on the related order entity. The most important of these properties are listed in the following table.

| Property                           | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AuthorizationTransactionId**     | The ID of a payment authorization. Usually this comes from a payment gateway.                                                  |
| **AuthorizationTransactionCode**   | A payment transaction code. Not used by Smartstore. This can be any data that the payment provider needs for later processing. |
| **AuthorizationTransactionResult** | A short result info about the payment authorization.                                                                           |
| **CaptureTransactionId**           | The ID of a payment capture. Usually this comes from a payment gateway. Can be equal to `AuthorizationTransactionId`.          |
| **CaptureTransactionResult**       | A short result info about the payment capture.                                                                                 |
| **SubscriptionTransactionId**      | The ID for payment subscription. Usually used for recurring payment.                                                           |

Except for `AuthorizationTransactionCode` and `SubscriptionTransactionId`, this information is displayed on the order page in the admin backend but they are not further processed or used in any other way by Smartstore.

If more payment data needs to be stored in the database for an order, then this should be done using the `GenericAttribute` entity. Suppose you have a provider for installment payment. Then the following code saves the interest and the order total including interest for a certain order.

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class MyPaymentOrderData
{
    [JsonIgnore]
    public static string Key => "MyCompany.MyModule.OrderAttribute";

    public decimal Interest { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalInclInterest { get; set; }
}

public override async Task PostProcessPaymentAsync(
    PostProcessPaymentRequest postProcessPaymentRequest)
{
    Order order = postProcessPaymentRequest.Order;    
    // TODO: get "decision" from somewhere, e.g. custom checkout state.
    string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new MyPaymentOrderData
    {
        Interest = decision.Interest,
        TotalInclInterest = decision.TotalInclInterest
    });
    
    order.GenericAttributes.Set(MyPaymentOrderData.Key, json, order.StoreId);
    await order.GenericAttributes.SaveChangesAsync();    
}
```

## Webhooks and IPNs

Webhooks and IPNs (Instant Payment Notification) are HTTP-based callback functions the payment provider uses to send payment related messages to a shop, e.g. a payment status change. It is a kind of cross web application event system. The message handler typically updates the [payment status](creating-a-payment-provider.md#payment-status) of an order according to the message. See the `AmazonPayController.IPNHandler` as an example of an IPN handler.

WARN: In case of misuse, these messages do not originate from the payment provider. The transmitted data should not be processed or stored directly. Instead, another call to the API of the payment provider is required to verify the authenticity. The handler then processes the data returned from the API. Some providers additionally give out IP addresses from which their IPNs originate, which can then be additionally verified.

### WebhookEndpoint attribute

Each action method that receives and processes webhooks or IPNs must be decorated with the `WebhookEndpointAttribute`. It's a marker filter with the purpose to suppress customer resolution for such endpoints. The attribute prevents unnecessary creation of guest customers (as long as HTTP callbacks do not send any cookies). Instead, a system account with the system name `WebhookClient` is used.

### Testing webhooks and IPNs

We recommend using the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) service to test webhooks and IPNs. The service allows you to receive webhook messages and IPNs over an HTTP or HTTPS tunnel locally on localhost. It comes with a console windows app named `ngrok.exe` that you have to download. The messages then reach your local shop through this tunnel, as long as the `ngrok.exe` is running and the tunnel is alive. The advantage of this service is that it is simply attached to your development environment. You don't have to change or switch anything at your existing system like firewall, host, SSL, DDNS etc.

TIP: it will be even easier if you run `ngrok.exe` via a simple batch script which already contains your localhost URL.

{% code title="ngrok-localhost-59318.bat" %}
```actionscript
%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd /C "C:\Tools\ngrok\ngrok.exe http 59318 -host-header="localhost:59318""
pause
```
{% endcode %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ngrok.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Active ngrok HTTP tunnel making a local shop reachable under localhost:59318.</p></figcaption></figure>

Under **Forwarding** you see the two URLs that you can use to receive messages. You can enter them in the backend of the payment provider, together with the path to the action method that receives and processes payment messages. If the payment provider does not provide a setting for this and the URL must be supplied by code, then you can also add a setting for the ngrok URL in the configuration of your payment method, which should only be visible in developer mode.

## Logging and order notes

Much of what a payment module does is done in the background. It is important to store information about it and about the respective payment process in order to be able to track it more easily.

It is recommended to add order notes for each communication with the payment gateway that causes any data update (including webhook messages and IPNs). This allows the merchant to track which and when data has been exchanged with the payment provider. Set `HasNewPaymentNotification` of the order entity to `true` if you receive a webhook message or IPN. A small info badge appears in the order list of the administration backend indicating that a new IPN has been received for this order.

Also log all errors (in detail) that occurred while exchanging data with the payment gateway. This information makes it easier for the payment provider's support to determine the cause of a payment problem.

### Payment method types

| Payment method type        | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unknown**                | Type is unknown.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Standard**               | All payment information is entered on the payment selection page.                                                                                                        |
| **Redirection**            | A customer is redirected to a third-party site to complete the payment after (!) the order has been placed. This type of processing is required for older payment types. |
| **Button**                 | Payment via button on cart page.                                                                                                                                         |
| **StandardAndButton**      | All payment information is entered on the payment selection page and is available via button on cart page.                                                               |
| **StandardAndRedirection** | Payment information is entered in checkout and customer is redirected to complete payment (e.g. 3D Secure) after the order has been placed.                              |

### Payment status

The payment status is import because it is used to control processes for orders. For example, the button for later capturing of the payment amount is displayed only, if the payment (transaction) has been authorized (payment status `Authorized`).

|                       |                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pending**           | The initial payment status if no further status information is available yet.                                                                             |
| **Authorized**        | The payment has been authorized (but not captured) by the payment provider. Usually this means that the payment amount is reserved for later capturing.   |
| **Paid**              | The payment has been captured against the payment gateway. It does not necessarily mean that the paid amount has been credited to the merchant's account. |
| **PartiallyRefunded** | The paid amount has been partially refunded.                                                                                                              |
| **Refunded**          | The paid amount has been fully refunded.                                                                                                                  |
| **Voided**            | The payment has been cancelled.                                                                                                                           |

One task of a payment provider is therefore to set the payment status to `Authorized` or `Paid` according to the feedback from the payment gateway. Usually this is done in `ProcessPaymentAsync` or an action method for webhooks or IPNs.
