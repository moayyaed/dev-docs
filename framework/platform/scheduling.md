# ðŸ¥š Scheduling

## Overview

* Executes automated tasks, e.g.: cleanup files, cleanup database, send emails, rebuild XML sitemap, periodic imports or exports etc.
* Perfect for long-running processes or expensive stuff.



* Is a **web** scheduler
* No timer that executes tasks, but...
* ...a timer polls the web scheduler HTTP endpoint every minute
* The endpoint determines all overdue tasks and executes them within the scope of a HTTP request
* This guarantees that the dependency scope is always up and running. No need to create custom scopes.
* The task context virtualizer ([ITaskContextVirtualizer](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Services/ITaskContextVirtualizer.cs)) will virtualize some environment parameters during task execution (unless specified otherwise):
  * `IWorkContext.CurrentCustomer` --> BackgroundTask system customer
  * `IStoreContext.CurrentStore` --> Primary (first) store

## Task descriptor

* The [TaskDescriptor](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Domain/TaskDescriptor.cs) domain entity defines the task metadata: name, cron expression, whether it is enabled or not, priority, task type to execute etc.
* This entity is saved in database
* Some parts can be edited by the user in the backend, e.g. cron expression, enabled etc.
* A task's cron expression specifies the next run time
* When a task has run, a history entry is created containing infos about: time of execution, duration, name of machine that leased the execution, error etc.
* A task can also be triggered manually by the user in the backend
* Every running task can be cancelled explicitly in the backend

## Implementing a task

* Any concrete class implementing the [ITask](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Services/ITask.cs) interface
* No need to register in DI, it is auto-discovered and registered as a scoped service on app startup. So: task types can take any dependency.
* `Run` method is the task handler. No sync-counterpart!
* The task executor will call this method asynchronously and await it
* Any exception raised during execution (either unhandled or explicity) will stop execution. The error will be logged. If the task descriptor's `StopOnError` property is `true`, task will be disabled and will not run anymore (unless user turns it on again).
* By default, the task type's name (without namespace) is `TaskDescriptor.Type`. To specify another name - e.g. to avoid potential type name conflicts with other tasks - decorate your class with [TaskNameAttribute](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Services/TaskNameAttribute.cs) and pass a custom name.
* INFO: if the task resolver determined more than one overdue task within a single poll operation, they will NOT be executed in parallel, but one after another. If a task's execution is not finished on the next poll (next minute), the executor will skip it.
* INFO: Because of the minutely polling, it makes no sense to define cron expression with less fraction, e.g. "every 30 seconds".
* _SAMPLE_

## Task cancellation

* Every task should be cancellable, especially those that are long-running
* Remember that the user can request cancellation in the backend
* Therefore the `CancellationToken` parameter is passed. It combines app shutdown token and user cancellation token.
* Regularly check whether cancellation is requested and try to gracefully quit your task
* _Regular_ means: not necessarily in every iteration, bur after a batch of something has completed.
* _SAMPLE_
* Or just throw if cancellation was requested
* _SAMPLE_ (ThrowIfCancellationRequested())

## Propagating task progress

* The task scheduler UI in backend can display task progress (either message, percent or both)
* But you must provide this info
* The [TaskExecutionContext](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Services/TaskExecutionContext.cs) parameter passed to the `Run` method contains the `SetProgress` method (with different overloads and sync/async variants).
* Call it to propagate progress. Your progress is saved to database immediately.
* The UI fetches refreshed progress info every seconds and can now display it

## Adding or removing tasks programmatically

* Necessary if your module provides tasks
* In this case task must be added to task store during module installation and removed during uninstallation

{% code title="Add and remove tasks programmatically" %}
```csharp
internal class Module : ModuleBase
{
    private readonly ITaskStore _taskStore;

    public Module(ITaskStore taskStore)
    {
        _taskStore = taskStore;
    }

    public override async Task InstallAsync(ModuleInstallationContext context)
    {
        // Add the task, if it does not exist yet.
        await _taskStore.GetOrAddTaskAsync<MyTaskImplType>(x =>
        {
            x.Name = "My localized task display name";
            x.CronExpression = "0 */1 * * *"; // every hour
            x.Enabled = true;
        });

        await base.InstallAsync(context);
    }

    public override async Task UninstallAsync()
    {
        // Try to remove the task. Do nothing if it does not exist.
        await _taskStore.TryDeleteTaskAsync<MyTaskImplType>();

        await base.UninstallAsync();
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

## System tasks

* If you want to hide a task from the user, `TaskDescriptor.IsHidden` must be set to `true`.
* This prop cannot be edited by the user.
* A hidden task is not displayed in task scheduler UI.
* But you can invoke the `MinimalTaskViewComponent` to render a single task's state anywhere you want
* The component displays task common info in a very compact widget
* _SCREENSHOT_
* It displays progress info if the task is currently running + a cancel button, or
* it provides buttons to execute the task immediately and to edit the cron expression.

{% code title="Invoking the MinimalTask view component" %}
```cshtml
@await Component.InvokeAsync("MinimalTask", new 
{ 
	// The TaskDescriptor entity id
	taskId = Model.TaskId, 
	// "false" hides the "Cancel" button for a running task
	cancellable = false
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Executing single tasks programmatically

* To execute a single task programmatically call `ITaskScheduler.RunSingleTaskAsync()`
* Pass the unique identifier of the task you want to execute (`TaskDescriptor.Id`)
* Pass optional parameters as a dictionary --> will be converted to URL querystring.
  * You can access passed parameters via `TaskExecutionContext.Parameters` property
  * To virtualize the current customer during task execution, pass **CurrentCustomerId** as parameter
  * To virtualize the current store during task execution, pass **CurrentStoreId** as parameter
* _SAMPLE_

## Task leasing

* By default, tasks are executed exclusively.&#x20;
* Meaning: during execution task gets locked. So, even in a web-farm only one server can execute a single task.&#x20;
* First server always wins. Other servers will skip the already running task.
* To change this behavior (letting each server in a web-farm execute a task decidedly): Set `TaskDescriptor.RunPerMachine` to `true`.
* This makes sense if your task does something that needs to be done on each server redundantly. E.g.: cleaning up local files, creating redundant/replicated indexes etc.
* INFO: The user cannot edit this setting in the backend.

## Implementing a custom Task Store provider

* [ITaskStore](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore/Scheduling/Services/ITaskStore.cs)
* The default implementation stores task info and progress in database
* We cannot think of any scenario where it makes sense to override this :-)
* But for the sake of completeness:
* Create a class that implements `ITaskStore`
* Follow the contract and implement all members
* Register your custom class in service container --> will overwrite the default registration
* _SAMPLE_ (for registration, NOT for impl)

## Troubleshooting

* To poll for overdue tasks, the scheduler must call an HTTP URL every minute via an `HttpClient` instance
* On app startup, the scheduler does its best to determine a host name / a base url that actually works. It tests several host names in following order:
  * Request host name
  * localhost
  * 127.0.0.1
  * Machine's local IP address
* Even then, it may sometimes happen that none of the tested hosts work due to environmental issues. In this case:
* Specify a custom base url via _appsettings.json_. Search for `TaskSchedulerBaseUrl` entry and set a valid and working url, e.g. **`http://www.mystore.com`**
* Don't forget to restart the application.
* INFO: Inspect the application logs to check for any scheduler polling errors
