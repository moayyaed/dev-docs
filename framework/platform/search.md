## Overview

[ICatalogSearchService](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Catalog/Search/ICatalogSearchService.cs) enables product searches based on search terms. The interface has two implementations. `CatalogSearchService` searches for products by implementations of [IIndexProvider](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexProvider.cs), [IIndexStore](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexStore.cs) and [ISearchEngine](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/ISearchEngine.cs). An example of such an extension is the Smartstore _MegaSearch_ module, which connects the search library Lucene.Net to Smartstore. Without such an extension, `LinqCatalogSearchService` is used, which searches the database directly for hits using LINQ.

The `CatalogSearchingEvent` is published right before a catalog search regardless of whether the search is performed with `CatalogSearchService` or `LinqCatalogSearchService`. Accordingly, `CatalogSearchedEvent` is published at the end of a search.

## Search query

`CatalogSearchQueryFactory` reads query string parameters and creates a `CatalogSearchQuery` from it, which contains all the information needed for the search engine to perform the search. Parameters are typically used to filter the search result. Possible parameters:

| Query token | Type    | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------: | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       **q** | string  | Search **query**/term.                                                                                         |
|       **i** | int     | Specifies the **page index** (starting from 1).                                                                |
|       **s** | int     | Specifies the **page size** of search hits.                                                                    |
|       **o** | int     | Specifies how to **order** the search hits. For supported values see `ProductSortingEnum`.                     |
|       **p** | decimal | Filters products by a **price range**. Supported formats: _from\~to_, _from(\~)_ or _\~to_.                    |
|       **c** | int     | Filters products by assigned **categories**. Supports a comma separated list of category identifiers.          |
|       **m** | int     | Filters products by assigned **manufacturers**. Supports a comma separated list of manufacturer identifiers.   |
|       **r** | double  | Filters products by their minimum **rating**. Supports values from 0 to 5.                                     |
|       **a** | bool    | Filters products by their **stock level**.                                                                     |
|       **n** | bool    | Filters for **newly arrived products**.                                                                        |
|       **d** | in      | Filters products by assigned **delivery times**. Supports a comma separated list of delivery time identifiers. |
|       **v** | string  | Specifies the **view mode** for search hits. Supported value are _grid_ or _list_.                             |

More parameters available for filtering products by variants and attributes if the _MegaSearchPlus_ module is installed. They are prefixed by _attr_ (product attribute), _vari_ (product variant) or _opt_ (option value of attribute or variant).

HINT: parameter tokens can be overwritten by the user in the backend via alias fields (see [ISearchAlias](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/ISearchAlias.cs)). For example if the manufacturer's name should appear in the URL instead of the token _m_.

`CatalogSearchQuery` also contains the search term, the field(s) to be searched, the search mode and many other settings.\
HINT: these settings can have a huge impact on the performance of a search. For instance `SearchMode.Contains` is significantly slower than `SearchMode.ExactMatch`. If you do not need facets to be returned, turn it off by calling `BuildFacetMap(false)`. If you do not need spell check, turn it off by calling `CheckSpelling(0)`.

The `ICatalogSearchService.PrepareQuery` method lets you build or modify your own catalog search query using LINQ.

## Filter

Filters are needed to limit search results, e.g. to display only products of a certain category. They are determined by `CatalogSearchQueryFactory` via the query string and passed on to the search using of `CatalogSearchQuery`. If you want to search programmatically, you can create a `CatalogSearchQuery` instance and define it yourself using fluent notation:

```csharp
var searchQuery = new CatalogSearchQuery()
    .VisibleOnly()
    .WithVisibility(ProductVisibility.Full)
    .HasStoreId(Services.StoreContext.CurrentStoreIdIfMultiStoreMode)
    .WithCategoryIds(null, categoryIds.ToArray())
    .BuildFacetMap(false)
    .BuildHits(false);
    
var searchResult = await _catalogSearchService.SearchAsync(searchQuery);
```

There are several types of filters, which all inherit from `ISearchFilter`. `ICombinedSearchFilter` is needed, for example, when filtering for several category IDs (logically OR combined). `IRangeSearchFilter` is used when filtering for a price range.

A LINQ search like `LinqCatalogSearchService` translates the filters in `CatalogSearchQuery` into an `IQueryable<Product>` that can be used to load product entities directly from the database. The `ISearchEngine` implementation of _MegaSearch_ translates them into a query filter that is compatible with Lucene.Net.

## Facets

Facets are used to refine search results to allow users to narrow a large set of products down to only those that match specific criteria. This includes also to reduce the amount of filters to those which are able to further narrow down the search result. This process is often also referred to as **drilldown navigation**. A search library like Lucene.Net is needed to obtain facets.

Facets are provided through `ISearchEngine.GetFacetMapAsync` and `ISearchProvider.GetFacetMap` but in practice a number of further steps are needed to make faceting work. [IFacetMetadataStorage](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Facets/IFacetMetadataStorage.cs) is used to load facet metadata from cache, from the search index or from both. For a drilldown navigation by brand for instance you need all brand\manufacturer names but for performance reason you don't want to load them from database, so you store them in the search index and retrieve them using `IFacetMetadataStorage`.

The first step is to iterate through `ISearchQuery.FacetDescriptors` to get the actual the requested facets. Next, for a particular descriptor, its metadata is loaded including all values to be faceted (e.g. brand names). Usually, all values are then iteratively applied to the bitset of the current search result via a bitwise and-operation to get the number of set bits (which is the number of search hits after applying a certain filter). This process is of course dependent on the search library.

## Indexing

Search libraries like Lucene.Net determine search hits via the file system instead of accessing databases directly. These files are called index or search index. Smartstore provides a whole range of interfaces for creating and managing search indexes and a _MegaSearch_ module which performs the actual indexing. Essentially, the process is as follows.

An [IIndexingService](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexingService.cs) implementation creates or updates the search index, always triggered by its own task. The index scope, that is the information about what kind of index it is, is obtained via the [IIndexScopeManager](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexScopeManager.cs). The indexing service uses a data collector (see [IIndexCollector](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexCollector.cs)) to collect all the data to be transferred to the index. The index service does not access the index directly, but uses the [IIndexStore](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexStore.cs) for this purpose. It ensures that the index can be accessed for writing (during indexing) and reading (during searching).

During an index update, the records to be updated are determined with the help of [IIndexBacklogService](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/Backlog/IIndexBacklogService.cs) and [IndexBacklogItem](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/Backlog/IndexBacklogItem.cs). Backlog items are previously determined and saved to the database via a hook, e.g. when a product has been modified.

The collector fires an [IndexSegmentProcessedEvent](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/Events/IndexSegmentProcessedEvent.cs) each time after it has processed a segment of entities. The indexing service fires an [IndexingCompletedEvent](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/Events/IndexingCompletedEvent.cs) at the end of indexing.

## Implementing a custom search

[IIndexScope](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/Indexing/IIndexScope.cs) and [ISearchProvider](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/blob/main/src/Smartstore.Core/Platform/Search/ISearchProvider.cs) are used to distinguish between different search scopes, like catalog (built-in search for products) and forum search (search for forum posts offered by forum module). To implement another search for a different entity, the principle of the catalog search must be copied and adapted accordingly.\
TODO: roughly describe what we did in the forum search...
