# Export

## Overview

* The data exporter provides the data in segments that are written in a specific format into a stream by an export provider.
* Export profiles are entities that are binding the export to an export provider and storing all settings and configurations of the export.
* When an export is executed, a task associated with the export profile is started, which performs the actual export via data exporter and export provider.
* Export deployments are entities that can optionally be assigned to an export profile to specify how to proceed with the export data (e.g. files), for example to send them to an e-mail address.
