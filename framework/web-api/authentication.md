# âœ” Authentication

Smartstore Web API uses _Basic Authentication_ over _HTTPS authentication_ method to protect data from unauthorized access. It is recommended by the _OData protocol version 4.0_ for the highest level of interoperability with generic clients.

The client sends the credentials by using the Authorization header. The credentials are formatted as the string `publicKey:secretKey` using UTF-8 and base64 encoding. The credentials are not encrypted, so HTTPS is required.

{% code title="Authentication example" %}
```csharp
var credentials = Convert.ToBase64String(
    Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"{publicKey}:{secretKey}"));

using var message = new HttpRequestMessage(
    new HttpMethod("GET"),
    "http://localhost:59318/odata/v1/Customers");

message.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", credentials);
// Authorization: Basic ZWE2NGQ0YTIyZGI1......ZDY4NGRlMDRmZEFiZGUwMmY3MTg=
```
{% endcode %}

The API will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code if the user is not authorized to exchange data via the API. In this case, the response HTTP headers **Smartstore-Api-AuthResultId** (ID of the denied reason) and **Smartstore-Api-AuthResultDesc** (short description of the denied reason) are sent with details of the reason for denial. In addition, the **WWW-Authenticate** header is sent with the value `Basic realm="Smartstore.WebApi", charset="UTF-8"`.

## Reasons for denial

| AuthResultId | AuthResultDesc             | Description                                                                                         |
