# üê£ Theme styling

## Overview

To create a completely different look & feel of the store frontend, it is sufficient to create a manifest file (`theme.config`) in a separate directory in the theme directory and define the variables. For deeper changes, add your own CSS to modify existing declarations, overwrite entire sections with your own CSS, or change the given HTML structure by overwriting it with your own Razor views.

## theme.scss

After `theme.config`, the most important file in a theme is `theme.scss`. It is the root Sass file that includes all other Sass files. Our Sass files are organized in a very granular way, representing each section of the store separately. For example, there is one file that contains all the CSS for the checkout process, one for the footer, one for the product detail page, and so on. A complete list of all included Sass files can be found below.

Bootstrap's Sass files are included very early in `theme.scss`, so you get access to Bootstrap's variables and mixins in subsequent includes.

For example, it's possible to use the mixins provided by Bootstrap for responsive rendering everywhere:

```scss
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    --content-padding-x: #{$content-padding-x};
} 
```

## AutoPrefixer

Smartstore has an integrated CSS autoprefixer to ensure compatibility with different browsers. It is enabled in production mode, but not in debug mode. This allows writing CSS code without vendor prefixes, because the Autoprefixer adds them automatically. It uses the latest available [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) data to add the prefix to each corresponding CSS property and value.
