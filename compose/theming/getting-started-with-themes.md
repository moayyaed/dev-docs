# Getting started with themes

## Overview

Summarize key concepts: inheritance, runtime variables, Sass runtime compilation, bundling & minification, AutoPrefixer, MVC/Views, Bootstrap, FontAwesome

Because of Razor & Sass runtime compilation you can edit templates and stylesheets while app is running.

Don't start from scratch: use _FLEX_ as base.
